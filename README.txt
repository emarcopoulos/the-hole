Hey all,

So, to play the game just:
	0) Make sure you downloaded the folder this file was in and put it somwehere besides the default download folder-- otherwise it won't work!

	1) Go into a web browser and press the 'Ctrl' key and the 'o' key at the same time. 
	2) It should open a file viewer, if it doesn't figure out how to open files in your broswer (probably "file"->"open"). 
	3) Navigate to the folder I sent you, and then open the file called index.html (or just index).

	1) Alternatively, just open the file in this folder called index.

Enjoy, please!
